# DL-FInal-Project
Deep Learning Graphics Final Project

Created by Dominic Onyedeke

Motivation: 
Interested by the mesmerizing fluid effects in modern games and films, yet frustrated by their computational cost. Oftentimes fluid simuations eat away frame rates from videogames and I wanted to test the speed difference of comparing a traditional Eulerian fluid simulation using a convolutional neural network versus one without.
